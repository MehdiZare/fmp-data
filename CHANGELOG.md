and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-09

[Compare changes](https://github.com/MehdiZare/fmp-data/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1)

### Fixed
- Fixed CI/CD workflow issues with uv package installation
- Added --system flag to uv pip install commands in GitHub Actions
- Removed unnecessary uv run prefix from build commands

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-09

[Compare changes](https://github.com/MehdiZare/fmp-data/compare/v0.5.2...v1.0.0)

### Added
- Production-ready release with stable API
- Comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Automated versioning with semantic release labels
- TestPyPI deployment for dev branch updates
- Test coverage exceeding 80% threshold for core modules

### Fixed
- Corrected field aliases in fundamental models (stockPrice)
- Fixed primitive type handling in base client
- Updated Alternative Markets endpoints to use /stable/ prefix
- Resolved isinstance() syntax for Python 3.10+ compatibility
- Fixed millisecond timestamp detection in alternative models

### Changed
- Migrated to UV package manager for faster dependency resolution
- Updated development status to Production/Stable
- Streamlined CI/CD workflows for automated releases
- Enhanced error handling and validation

### Breaking Changes
- **`get_quote` method relocation**: The `get_quote` method has been moved from `MarketClient` to `CompanyClient`

  **Migration steps:**
  ```python
  # Old (pre-1.0.0)
  quote = client.market.get_quote("AAPL")

  # New (1.0.0+)
  quote = client.company.get_quote("AAPL")
  ```

  **Rationale:** This change better aligns with the FMP API structure where company quotes are part of the company data domain.

- **Alternative Markets endpoint prefix change**: All Alternative Markets endpoints now use `/stable/` prefix instead of `/v3/`

  **Migration steps:**
  - No code changes required for users of the client library
  - Direct API users should update endpoint URLs from `/v3/` to `/stable/`

### Removed
- Removed deprecated sync_groups.py script
- Cleaned up duplicate dependency definitions
